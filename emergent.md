The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard is a community-led effort to standardize how we organize and describe neuroimaging data. BIDS currently supports multiple neuroimaging modalities and more are under active development. Our community is large and spread across disciplines and domains. In this Town Hall event we will announce recent BIDS achievements and updates from the BIDS extension proposal working groups. After announcements, we will open the Town Hall to public comment and questions. Representatives of the BIDS Steering and Maintainers groups will be present to respond to questions. We are eager to discuss the state and future of BIDS as a community standard!

We represent the OHBM Sustainability and Environmental Action Special Interest Group (SEA-SIG). During this session, we will present recent empirical work we have conducted on measuring and reducing the compute power and therefore the carbon emissions of preprocessing and statistical analysis of fMRI data. In particular, we will discuss how to use multiple carbon tracking tools and real-time carbon intensity task schedulers, including live demonstration of their use to attendees.

Green computing is an increasingly important aspect of socially responsible science, and intersects with a number of open science practices including preregistration of data processing parameters, development of clear data management plans, and reflection on how and where to share data publicly. We will reflect on these intersections and invite discussion on how we should best approach tensions between open science and sustainability.

Speaker Nick Souter will join the session virtually, and Niall Duncan and Nikhil Bhagwat will provide live presenation and demonstration in person in the OSR. Polona Kalc, incoming SEA-SIG chair, will also be present in person to introduce the session.

**Goals:**

- Learn the source of carbon emissions arise in neuroimaging computing and data storage
- Learn how to measure and reduce carbon emissions in their own neuroimaging data processing
- Reflect on best practice for environmentally sustainable and open neuroimaging research -->

### Emergent Session 4: Metavaluation: Kickstarting a Virtuous Cycle in Open Science

#### Cooper Smout. (1) Open Heart & Mind (OHM), (2) Institute for Globally Distributed Open Research and Education (IGDORE)
#### 9:15 (GMT+10) June 26 (Thursday)
[Join on Crowdcast](https://www.crowdcast.io/c/osr-2025-emergent-4-metavaluation)

*Crowdcast link will be released before the OHBM*

<p></p>
Open science faces a collective action problem: while everyone benefits from activities like data sharing, reproducible methods, and open peer review, these and many other essential contributions remain systemically undervalued. Despite decades of open science advocacy and countless viable alternatives, the adoption of open science principles, practices and platforms remains persistently low, primarily due to misaligned incentives.

**Metavaluation** addresses this crisis through a simple and inclusive peer evaluation mechanism that places all contributions on the same scale -- including evaluations themselves -- incentivizing engagement, value creation and collaboration across stakeholders. Critically, the same mechanism can also recognize and reward system improvements, alongside all other scholarly contributions, creating the potential for a virtuous cycle of value creation and systemic change.

Session goals:

- Introduce Metavaluation's conceptual foundations and core mechanics
- Share prototype data from diverse communities in academia and beyond, demonstrating how interoperable value-aligned metrics can foster coordination
- Preview our soon-to-be-released open-source MVP application
- Discuss potential use cases within the field of neuroimaging
- Share the vision and next steps for interested communities

### Emergent Session 5

<!-- #### Ana Van Gulick, Figshare, NIH Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative program -->
#### 11:30 (GMT+10) June 26 (Thursday)
<!-- [Join on Crowdcast](https://www.crowdcast.io/c/osr-2024-emergent-4) -->

<!-- <p></p>
The neuroimaging community has been a leader in open science and data sharing for many years and neuroimaging researchers are frequent users of both discipline-specific and generalist data repositories as part of their open science workflows. On behalf of the NIH Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative (GREI), we propose this emergent session to learn from the neuroimaging community about how they use generalist repositories (GRs) for sharing data and other research materials and to gather feedback on how GREI could prioritize its work to enhance GR functionality and resources to better serve the needs of this research community. 

In February 2022, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Data Science Strategy (ODSS) launched the [Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative](https://datascience.nih.gov/data-ecosystem/exploring-a-generalist-repository-for-nih-funded-data) (GREI), which brings together seven generalist repositories ([Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/), [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash), [Figshare](https://figshare.com/), [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/), [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/), [Vivli](https://vivli.org/), and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)) to work collaboratively to enhance support for data sharing and discovery in GRs. GREI recognizes that GRs play a key role in the data sharing landscape for the FAIR sharing of data in trusted repositories, offering broad flexibility to publish any file type and any research output alongside discipline- and method-specific data repositories when they are available, especially for researchers seeking to comply with global data sharing mandates and to practice open science. Together the GREI repositories are working to enhance common metadata, persistent identifiers, and standard metrics to support cross repository search to lower the barriers for data sharing and reuse. 

In this emergent session we propose presenting a short overview of GREI goals and activities to enhance GR support for data sharing and discovery. We will then facilitate an interactive audience poll activity and audience discussion to learn about neuroimaging use cases for GRs including for sharing non-data materials and to uncover gaps in GR functionality and needs for resources or other support.

GREI would like to learn from OSR participants about their data sharing and repository experiences and hear from researchers what GRs could do to better support them through functionality or resources. Conducting community engagement with disciplinary research communities is a key objective for GREI that the program will use to inform our future work and we recognize that while many data repository resources are available in the neuroimaging community, the volume and diversity of research outputs to share necessitates the use of GRs for some outputs. Neuroscience is a top research category for all of the GREI repositories, often in part because these repositories are used to publish materials beyond data including software and code, images and media files, workflows, posters and presentations, and other supplementary files. GRs are also often used in conjunction with disciplinary repositories and data standards. We believe that as users of GRs and keen practitioners of open science with a wide variety of data types and research outputs to share, the neuroimaging community is an especially valuable group for GREI to engage with to inform our work. 

**Goals:**

- Briefly present the objectives and outputs of the NIH Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative
- Conduct an interactive audience poll exercise to learn how neuroimaging researchers use GRs alongside discipline-specific data repositories to share data and other research materials 
- Facilitate an audience discussion to gather feedback about how generalist repositories could enhance their functionality and resources to better serve the needs of the neuroimaging community -->

### Emergent Session 6: Showcasing open data with run-anywhere open examples

#### Vijay Iyer, MathWorks
#### 9:10 (GMT+10) June 27 (Friday)
[Join on Crowdcast](https://www.crowdcast.io/c/osr-2025-emergent-6-opendata)

<p></p>
Increasing interests in (and requirements for) making scientific data publicly available has driven the launch and growth of a range of scientific data repositories with various storage back-ends, often cloud-based. This proposed emergent session is about the front-end: how can sharers of open datasets best showcase what's in their datasets, so their contemporary and future colleagues can appreciate, understand, re-analyze, and even potentially reach new insights and discoveries from their hard-won data? The host(s) believe that open examples -- publicly viewable and runable computational notebooks with code & text that accesses, explains, and uses the open data -- are a/the key ingredient to drive more engagement with and scientfic advances from open datasets. This session will get into the nitty gritty of puzzles, emerging best practices, and other considerations for producing and disseminating such open examples, such as how remote data is best accessed, data subsetting, cloud & containerized example sandboxes, and more.

### Emergent Session 7: Perspectives on the Future of Publishing in Neuroinformatics

#### GigaScience Press
#### 11:30 (GMT+10) June 27 (Friday) 
[Join on Crowdcast](https://www.crowdcast.io/c/osr-2025-emergent-7-publishing)

<p></p>
With the increasing growth of extremely large-scale data research, tools, computational methods and AI, publishing needs to keep up with these rapid advances and move beyond the PDF, without compromising the open science ethos of OHBM.

This emerging session will include three journals - Aperture Neuro, Imaging Neuroscience and GigaByte. A representative from each journal will present their perspectives and experiences on what the future of FAIR publishing in the context of neuroinformatics may look like. The overall goal is to show researchers the options available in open science publishing and foster discussion on publishing and how journals can better serve the neuroinformatics community.

<h2>Introductions to Emergent Sessions</h2>

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="hJ6i2jUQlnQ" %}
<p align="justify">**What are Emergent Sessions?**</p>
<p align="justify"> Emergent Sessions are spontaneous and interactive hot topic talks hosted by OSR attendees. Emergent sessions may last from 30 minutes to one hour (ideally 30 minutes planned talk and 30 minutes discussion). The duration will be set by the participant organizer, or it will run for as long as the conversation is flowing. Emergent Sessions can be framed as conversations held in an open format among peers. These sessions may be used to invite contributions to collaborative projects, hold an open forum to discuss a development in existing projects, hold a panel discussion, or basically anything you would like!</p>
