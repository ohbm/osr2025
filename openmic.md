title: 5-minute Open Mics
---

### New featured session in 2024...
#### Time: 10:30-11:00 (GMT+9) & 12:45-13:15 (GMT+9) on June 25 (Tuesday)

This year, we introduce a new format at the OSR: the Open Mics session. In this session, participants from all levels are welcomed to have a 5-minute time slot, during which they can express or share what their thoughts on Open Science with the community. It is a good place to promote your software, your research, your ideas, or even your opinions related to Open Science. There will be no Q&A time after each presentation, but we encourage everyone interested to approach the speaker and initiate a conversation. We hope this format allow people to share thoughts and ideas that are less polished but could be worthwhile for the community to know, to think about, or even to contribute.
