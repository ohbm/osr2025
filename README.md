### Credit
The [OSR website](https://ohbm.github.io/osr2025) was built using the [Beautiful Jekyll](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) theme by [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/).


#### Instructions for building website (these must be run prior to uploading onto GH)
+ Check the speaker/volunteer CSV files are in place (in _data/speakers, _data/volunteers)
Wipe the built directories if they already exist, and re-build: 
`rm -r _speakers _volunteers; bundle exec jekyll pagemaster speakers volunteers`
Commit the new directories and push the site. This must be done every time the CSV files are changed. 

+ If `bundle exect` error out, do the following things:

    1. Create Gemfile
    2. Follow the errors and add all required dependencies
    3. Run `bundel install`
